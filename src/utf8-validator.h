/**

 *
 * The UTF-8 validator reads chunks of bytes of arbitary length and outputs
 * chunks containing only complete UTF-8 sequences. Sequences overlapping the
 * chunk boundaries are joined. Invalid bytes and sequences are replaced with
 * the replacement glyph ï¿½ (0xFFFD).
 *
 * The validator uses the checks suggested by Markus G. Kuhn
 * <http://www.cl.cam.ac.uk/~mgk25/> using the test file
 * <http://www.cl.cam.ac.uk/~mgk25/ucs/examples/UTF-8-test.txt>.
 *
 * The following is considered to be invalid:
 *
 * - Invalid initial bytes and detached continuation bytes
 * - Incomplete sequences
 * - Overlong glyph representations
 * - Low and high surrogates
 * - Glyphs in the "internal use area"
 *
 * ## Example
 *
 * ```
 * size_t dataSize;
 * uint8_t* data = readFile("UTF-8-test.txt", &dataSize);
 *
 * uint8_t buffer[4096];
 * utf8_validator validator = {0};
 *
 * uint8_t* dataPtr = data;
 * size_t inSize = dataSize;
 * size_t outSize;
 *
 * while (inSize) {
 *     outSize = sizeof(buffer);
 *     utf8_validate(&validator, &dataPtr, &inSize, buffer, &outSize);
 *
 *     if (outSize) {
 *         handleChunk(buffer, outSize);
 *     }
 * }
 * ```
 *
 * The stream end is signalled by giving an empty chunk. This is to check for a
 * possible truncation of the last sequence.
 *
 * ```
 * outSize = sizeof(buffer);
 * utf8_validate(&validator, NULL, NULL, buffer, &outSize);
 *
 * if (outSize) {
 *     handleChunk(buffer, outSize);
 * }
 * ```
 *
 * The output buffer size should be around 4096 bytes. The absolute minimum size
 * is 72 bytes, which is really ineffective.
